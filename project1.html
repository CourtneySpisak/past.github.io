                <p class= "description">I made this glitch art using a combination of Audacity and Photoshop. Both glitch art pieces were made using a different method. The first image is a glitch art of a picture I took at Stonehendge. I opened the image as data in audacity. Then I edited the audio data that was produced from this image. After that I saved this audio back as an image, which I opened in Photoshop. The second image was produced from a song which I opened in Audcaity. After tweaking the audio data in Audacity, I opened the file in Photoshop. I then cut the produced image into several random pieces. I add different colors to the pieces and randomly arranged them on the canvas to create a new glitchy image. </p>
